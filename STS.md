Single Tox Standard Draft v.0.1.0 (rev 1)
===
As Tox grows and more clients are created, we feel it is time to  create a Tox standard. Doing so will enable us to promote a single, cohesive brand despite the numerous clients. STS aims to offer a handbook for existing and potential client developers to follow so they can all remain consistent, yet unique in their own way. This will prevent confusion for users who wish to switch clients, and allow Tox to focus on pushing a single brand. At the moment, we are strongly recommending adherence to the STS, as it will foster a more productive environment, but we recognize that it's the right of the developer to choose.

##User Identification & Interaction
###The Tox ID
- Users exchange a 76-character string containing hexadecimal representations of a public key, a nospam value, and a checksum to be used as an identifier. This is to be called the **Tox ID**.
- Users may set a **Name** which offers a simpler means of identification once the friend request has been accepted. These names may be changed on-the-fly and do not alter the Tox ID in any way.
- Users may set a **Status**. The three statuses are **"Online, Away, and Busy"**.
- Users may set a **Status message** , which is an arbitrary string of text that allows for updates about life activities, current willingness to converse, etc.

###Friend Requests
There are three fields a Tox client must offer when a user goes to add another. While two of these fields are optional for the end-user to fill out, it is required that Tox clients provide all three fields in the UI. These are, and should be labeled as, as follows:

| Type | Requirement | Description
| --- | --- | ---
| **Tox ID** | Required | The user can paste a Tox ID into the field, or, alternatively, if the user is on a mobile device, the option to use scan a QR code should also be offered
| **Nickname** | Optional | The user can set a custom nickname for the friend they're about to add  
| **Message** | Optional | The user can send a custom message to be displayed to the friend they're adding, either for identification purposes, or anything else.

###Friends List
Each client should include a way to manage friend lists, including the ability to edit Nicknames, view last time a user has logged on, and perform various actions, such as friend deletion, etc.

###Group Messaging
Tox allows for group messaging, where users may join a specified Tox ID and will be able to communicate in one "room". These are to be referred to as **Groupchats**. Clients will have a lot of leeway when it comes to the implementation of Groupchats, as each will offer a unique approach to it. However, they are a basic necessity and are required to be implemented, whatever the approach may be.

###Multimedia messaging
A/V support is mandatory in all clients unless the platform does not support it. (EX: video support isn't necessary for CLI clients.) Developers should strive to reduce delay as much as possible. Clients that have trouble keeping audio and video in perfect sync with each other or that add unacceptable latency to audio or video are not acceptable.

###Emoticons
While toxcore supports Unicode, user support varies.
Sending clients, and only the sending clients, are responsible for transforming recognized text sequences into Unicode emoji characters.  

Receiving clients shall display the received text without applying further transformations to received text. If Unicode emoji characters are not supported on the receiving side, it's time to invest in a better text rendering system.

###Message splitting
Clients should split messages at the last whitespace character closest to ``TOX_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`` (Currently 1368) characters. Whitespace character(s) are(is) `` `` (most symbols end with a space). An example of this follows:
- user enters over ``TOX_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`` characters in a text box.
- Text box follows with this unless it has some restrictions or breaks the UI scaling.
- Client splits message at ``TOX_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`` and searches backwards for the next whitespace character.
- The data between the start of the set of bytes and the whitespace character are sent
- The data after the whitespace character is appended to the rest of the message
- the client repeats step 3 until the bytes left is under ``TOX_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH``
- The UI on the sender would show a new sent message for each broken section so they are aware.
- The receiving client gets multiple separate messages like normal and displays them normally.

###Encodings
All messages sent over Tox should be encoded in UTF-8. While clients can not expect that all data they receive is encoded in UTF-8, they should do one of the following when receiving non-UTF-8 messages:
- Discard the received message completely
- Attempt to guess the encoding and re-encode as UTF-8 before showing the message to the user.
If a user enters non-UTF-8 messages core should re-encode them as far as possible, using the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) for characters they cannot encode.

##Client paths/formats
###Tox data directory
The path for Tox data on Windows is ``%APPDATA%/tox/`` (should this be roaming app data?)

The path for Tox data on Linux is ``~/.config/tox/`` 

This was chosen to work with as many existing clients as possible while allowing users to switch clients easily without loosing friends and IDs.

##User Safety
###NoSpam Changing
All Tox IDs have attached a small NoSpam Key to prevent friend request spam. All clients should include a quick method of changing the NoSpam Key in the event of spam. This should never be done automatically, and should require an explicit action from the user. For more information on what the NoSpam Key is, and what it does, visit our [API Docs](https://libtoxcore.so)


##User profiles
The Tox ID and its associated friends list and save file is called a profile. Save files should use the ".tox" extension to denote that they are Tox save files; clients should recognize .tox save files, preferably via integration with the operating system. That way, merely by double clicking a .tox file, the client will import the file for use. Here, import means copy the file into the data directory (see "Tox data directory" below). When talking about a profile's name, we mean the base name of the file.

###Profile management
Clients should be able to track more than one Tox ID (i.e., its save file) in the same data directory. Clients should thus offer the ability to switch profiles (i.e., disconnect from the network, load a different profile, and reconnect), as well as import, rename, export, and delete profiles. These operations are relative to the data directory: importing means copying a file to the data directory, exporting means allowing the user to save a profile in a location of their choice, and deleting means removing the profile from the data directory. Together, these operations make it easy for a user to share a Tox ID and friend's list among whatever devices he or she uses.

###Recommendations regarding profile management
Clients should encourage good user habits.
1) Warn the user when they are about to export an unencrypted profile
2) Warn the user when they are about to delete a profile currently in use

Clients on operating systems where accessing the file system directly is difficult should integrate with that OS's means of sharing files, by e.g. offering to attach a profile to an email (where warning 1 applies).

##Avatars
See https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/docs/Avatars.md#using-avatars-in-client-applications

##User Discovery
###Tox URI scheme
The Tox URI scheme is as follows: `tox:`. A client must accept `{CLIENT_NAME} tox:{PASSED}`. A client must then check to see if this is a standard ID or DNS discovery ID. If this is a standard ID, a client should show the user the ID, asking if they want to add said ID. A negative response should close the client (unless the client was already open prior to the URI event), while an affirmative response should add the ID. If a DNS discovery ID is detected, a client should resolve this. A client then follows DNS Discovery procedure to verify this, notifying the user if it is wrong. Having resolved this, the user should be asked whether he wishes to add the ID. As before, a negative response should close the client while a positive should add the ID. If the ID is malformed, the client should alert the user, closing the client after acknowledgement.

#####BNF of Tox URI Scheme
```
<uri-scheme> ::= "tox:" <tox-id>
<uri-scheme> ::= "tox:" <tox user>@<domain>
```

###DNS Discovery
A DNS discovery ID goes in the following format: `user@domain`. Users should not enter a DNS discovery ID in any way differently to adding a Tox ID - clients should be capable of identifying whether the input is a DNS discovery ID or a Tox ID. On adding a DNS discovery ID, a client must resolve a DNS TXT record for the value `user._tox.domain.`. Note the end dot. In this case the `@` is replaced with `_tox`, allowing the use of subdomains while ensuring a record is a Tox record. Typical records lack spaces, though clients should be able to deal with oddly formatted cases. Clients are also encouraged to check DNSSEC, though this is not a requirement.

The `tox:` URI has 3 versions, tox1, tox2, and tox3. Tox3 is encrypted, though doesn't work with standard DNS servers and is hard to setup. Tox2 attempts to stop DNS request spamming and DNS poisoning attacks by using the a form of the nospam as a unique pin. Tox1 ignores these issues by listing just the Tox ID.

In the case of multiple records of different versions, clients should prioritize the highest version record. If there are more than one record of the same version, a client should use the first one in the order reported by the DNS lookup.

| Tox1        | Tox2          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| The value of a Tox DNS record goes `v=version;id=Tox ID`, where the version is tox1, and id is the users Tox ID. A client then follows the standard `tox:` scheme. Typical records lack spaces, though clients should be able to deal with oddly formatted cases.      | The value of a Tox DNS record goes `v=version;pub=public key;check=checksum`, where the version is tox2, pub is the public key, and the checksum is the XOR'd value of the nospam and public key. A client then asks the user for a pin, then it appends `==` to it, converts it from base64 to hexadecimal, and XOR's this against the key, checking it against the checksum to verify. |


#####BNF of Tox DNS URI Scheme v1 and v2
```
<dns-uri-scheme> ::= "tox:" <user> "@" <domain>
```

#####BNF of DNS Record v1 and v2
```
<dns-record-format> ::= <dns-record-type> " " <dns-record-name> "=" <dns-record-value>
<dns-record-type> ::= "TXT"
<dns-record-name> ::= <user> "._tox." <domain>
<dns-record-value> ::= "v=" <dns-record-version-1> ";" "id=" <tox-id> | "v=" <dns-record-version-2> ";" "pub=" <public-key> ";" "check=" <checksum>
<dns-record-version-1> ::= "tox1"
<dns-record-version-2> ::= "tox2"
```

`<user>` and `<domain>` you get from the URI,

`<tox-id>` is obtained from toxcore, `<public-key>` and `<checksum>` can be taken from <tox-id> (more info [here](http://api.libtoxcore.so/core_concepts.html#the-tox-id)).

#####Tox3 details
Tox3 uses toxdns in clients to do encryption/decryption. Clients get the server public key used in tox3 from ``_tox.<domain>``. This is in the following format: ```{public key}```

######raw details:
request:
[4 byte nonce][temporary client public key][encrypted with crypto_box(temporary client public key, server long term public key, 4 byte nonce + 20 byte zeros)[queried username]]
 
-> base32 (a to z, 0 to 5) -> separate with . as needed.
 
Notes:
- the temporary public key is a public key temporarily generated that is discarded right after the session is.
- 4 byte nonce must be increased by 1 on every request (it must not be generated randomly because birthday problem)
- every 2^32 requests (if that ever happens) the temporary client public key must be changed 
(two requests with the same nonce must never ever happen.)
 
response:
DNS TXT record:
[encrypted with crypto_box(temporary client public key, server long term public key, 4 byte nonce(sent in request) + 1 byte equal to 1 and 19 bytes of zeros (this is the same 4 byte nonce that was sent in the request))[Tox id (binary format)]]
 
-> base32 (same as above)
 
Possible issues with this:
- no PFS (find some way of making the server change its key every couple of days maybe?)
- clients need a local list of tox dns server long term public keys.

####Domain signing
Domain signing is an extension of DNS Discovery designed to further ensure DNS Discovery records have not been modified in transit or via existing DNS attacks. This becomes important with tox1 records where things like poisoning have not been mitigated. Domain signing works by appending an optional sign= to existing tox1 and tox2 records with a signature of the data of the record where this is compared to the known signing key for a domain. Domain signing uses crypto_sign_ed25519 from NaCl to sign and verify records.

- The signed data for Tox1 is the name of the record before the _tox + the Tox ID

- The signed data for Tox2 is the name of the record before the _tox + the public key + the check.

All data is signed in bytes to preserve space.

To validate this data a client would take the looked up user before the _tox and append it to the bytes version, comparing this to the output of the verifying function in NaCl. If this data is the same, the record is valid.

With Domain signing, the public key is also stored in a TXT record, using the format ```v=tox;pub={public key}```. It is important to note that due to potential issues wherein the public key may be the result of a poisoning attack, clients are encouraged to maintain a list of popular domains and keys. One such list is [here](http://wiki.tox.im/Domain_keys).

The path for Tox data files on Windows is ``%APPDATA%/tox``

The path for Tox data files on Linux is ``~/.config/tox``

This was chosen to work with as many existing clients as possible while allowing users to switch clients easily without losing friends and IDs.


## Translation of STS Terminology
Client developers must choose translations that resemble the English variations as closely as possible, except in the case where the Tox trademark is being used. For example, "Tox ID" is to remain, untouched, in English. In the future, translations will be provided for non-English Tox clients.


## Pending changes to the STS
The Single Tox Standard is created with heavy infulence from Tox community consensus. The following are proposed changes to the STS that are still have active discussion in progress. Want to have a voice? Join IRC [#tox-dev](irc://irc.freenode.net/tox-dev) on freenode.net and start asking questions.

### User Saftey / User Profile Encryption
> Discussion in progress

In order to prevent the threat of local data theft all Tox clients should offer a method to encrypt local data. Forcing data encryption or defaulting to encrypted data is not STS-required, but strongly suggested to keep user's Tox data safe.

###Logging
> Discussion in progress

- send a png named ``__avatar.png`` (This is two _'s) of no more than 1 MB. 
- The other client would accept it automatically without prompting the user. 
- If the image is over 1 MB the file transfer would not be accepted/completed. 
- Upon finishing the transfer the other client would attempt to render it, displaying a thumbnail if it fails.
 
If a client has an avatar saved it would display it. On starting a Tox client a client would attempt to send its avatar to each one of its friends. Upon setting a new avatar it would be sent to each one of its friends as well. If a new friend is added or comes online an avatar would be sent to him as soon as possible.
