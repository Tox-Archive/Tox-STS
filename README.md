Single Tox Standard
===

**Note: The Single Tox Standard has been deprecated by the [Tox Client Standard](https://github.com/tox/tox-client-standard).**

Due to the nature of Tox, clients and other various services have the freedom to name components as they wish. To promote the Tox brand more efficiently, as well as keeping the user experience a simple one, we **strongly recommend** that all clients abide by the STS: Single Tox Standard. This will afford users a smooth transition from client-to-client, and will allow Tox to promote a single, cohesive brand.
