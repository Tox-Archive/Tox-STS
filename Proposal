Change 'friend' to 'contact'
===========================
**Summary:** 

In Tox, contacts (Tox IDs) the user has added should be called 'contacts' rather than 'friends'. This has been discussed briefly in Tox/Tox-STS Issue 3, and more extensively in tux3/qTox Issue 1855. Following arguments should mostly come from there.

**Arguments for:** 

These are arguments for the proposal:
* The word 'friend' is unfitting and misleading.
  - The contacts do not have to be user's friends at all. They can be coworkers, classmates, relatives, or anyone else. With the wide variety of every person's own relationships and possible usages of Tox, calling contacts friends is improper.
  - The word 'contact' is accurate. All of the people on your list may not be your friends, but they will always be your contacts, since Tox can be used to contact them. It addresses all types of relationships between people.
  - The word 'friend' would be even more unfitting if Tox was used in work as a tool for business.
* The word 'friend' would be confusing in contact organizing.
  - If a Tox client implements organizing contacts into groups/aspects/circles, the user might like to make a group for their actual friends, and another groups for other people. Calling every contact a friend would be confusing and/or strange in this case.
* The word 'contact' is widely used and recognized in instant messaging, social networking and other services. Everyone understands its meaning, even in the computer world, so it will cause no confusion and misunderstandings.

**Arguments against:**

These are arguments against the proposal:
* 'Contact' is a very bad word and it's not good for UX.
* Facebook uses 'friend', too.
* 'Friend' is more familiar and comfortable for the user.

**Status quo:**

At the moment, 'friend' is used in most- if not all -Tox clients and the STS. Arguments for and against the change were provided in issues mentioned in the Summary, but neither issue led to a formal accepting nor declining of the suggestion, which finally led to the creation of this proposal.
