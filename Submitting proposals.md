# Submiting proposals / changes


## For submitters
* Submit proposal / change in pull request.
* Include in commit and pull request description what change is about → e.g. look at [template](proposals.md).
* Your pull request will be merged when majority (>=60%) of maintainers of main clients will agree on merging it.
* You may want to `@mention` maintainers in your pull request.


## For client maintainers
* Please make sure that your vote reflects not only your opinion, but also opinions of other people working on client you are maintaining.
* Please review the proposed changes carefully.
* Please, cast your vote, even if you don't really care. It's not like you have to do it right after a proposal has been submitted, but please do so in timely manner when you will have time - no one wants to wait very long `;)`


## For people with write access to this repo
* Do not merge or make changes to `STS.md` without going through pull request
* When you are merging pull request to `STS.md`
  - always make merge commit
  - in merge commit message put information about who voted, and what their votes were
* If you are changing "helper" (other than `STS.md`) files or merging pull request to them, please make sure that change is wanted and for better - please contact other people before changing it `;)`
